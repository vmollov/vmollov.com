    <h1 id="pageTitle">Biography</h1>
  	
    <p>I was born in Bulgaria on the 13th of January, 1983 to a family of self-taught wedding musicians.  As my father is also an accordionist, I was inspired by the sounds of the accordion since early childhood.  At eighteen months old, I "played" my little accordion alongside my father at weddings â€“ go to the photo gallery for proof!</p>
	<p>When I was seven I started taking formal accordion lessons with the nationally recognized pedagogue Nadejda Nicheva in Kazanluk, Bulgaria.  Later on I studied with Dr. Peter Marinov at the National Music Academy, the internationally recognized accordion artist Hristina Danova, and Nedelcho Dimitrov, a laureate of national and international accordion festivals and competitions.  Looking back I consider this to be a period of great musical growth and inspiration for me.</p>
	<p>Thanks to the impeccable guidance of my teachers and long hours of practicing, I received recognition at several Bulgarian and international accordion competitions.  At age thirteen I placed fourth in an accordion competition in Vladivostok. Two years later I placed first in the International Competition for Accordion and Guitar in Asenovgrad, Bulgaria, and received fourth place in the World Accordion Competition in Castelfidardo, Italy.  I also won first place at the 2002 National Competition for Variety Music and Jazz in Novi Pazar, Bulgaria, and second place with a special award for virtuosic performance of folk music in the National Accordion Competition 2000 in Plovdiv, Bulgaria.</p>
	<p>In 2002 I came to the United States to continue my education at Duquesne University.  I joined the DU Tamburitzans with whom I performed more than three hundred and fifty shows over a four-year period.  I still continue to arrange dance and instrumental music for the ensemble and still keep in touch with the many friends I made there.</p>
	<p>The years following graduation have been filled with multiple musical projects and endeavors.  In 2009, I recorded my first album, <i>Dreams</i>, featuring all original instrumental pieces based on Bulgarian ethnic music as well as French musette and jazz.  I am a founding member of the Argentinean tango quintet, Cuidado, with which I recorded an album featuring traditional and modern tangos as well as two of my original compositions. I have performed with the Kruno Spisic Gypsy Jazz Ensemble, Bulgarika, Daphne Alderson, and numerous other bands and artists.  I was also featured as a guest on Babik's 2008 gypsy jazz album, <i>American Gypsy</i>.</p>
	<p>During this time I had the misfortune of having my accordion ruined in transit by an unnamed airline on the way home from a concert.  As tragic as it was at the time, this lead to the purchase of my current instrument, the Siwa and Figli Super Quatro.  I have been a featured artist for Siwa and Figli Accordions since 2009 and would highly recommend their instruments.</p>
	<p>When not playing or writing music, I enjoy messing around with gadgets and learning about technology as well as watching movies with my wonderful wife.  I also have a day job as a web applications programmer.</p>
